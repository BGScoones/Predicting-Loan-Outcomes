We'll remove the rows for those loans whose statuses fall into neither category, and then we'll replace Fully Paid values with 1, and Charged Off with 0.\n",

That is, the dataset we're training our model on contains far more loans which were fully paid than those that were charged off. This can result in the model having a bias towards predicting the class with more observations, in this case, full paid. This would be a disaster for us.\n",

We'd miss out on funding some loans that would actually be good due to the bias of our model, but that would just mean less profit. However, given that our model would be biased towards predicting fully paid, we'd instead be funding loans which were actually bad, which would not just mean less profit, but potentially a loss.\n",
